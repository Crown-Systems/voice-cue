Welcome to VoiceCue, an online application that lets you find sentiments, tags, entities, and actions in your voice recordings instantly.
Currently, you are listening to the demo voice recording for presentation purposes, but feel free to upload your own voice recordings as well.
VoiceCue was built specifically as an entry for DEV.to and Deepgram hackathon from mid-March to mid-April in 2022. VoiceCue was built with NextJS and is based on Deepgram API, which is among the leading voice recognition solutions in the world, giving you streamlined access to all Deepgram trained speech recognition models.
I want to say thanks for this amazing opportunity. Building in public is the best way to learn, especially in such supportive communities as DEV.to.
If you want to try the speech recognition yourself, dont waste your time and go to the Deepgram website and sign up for 150$ free credit to test out their awesome API yourself.
