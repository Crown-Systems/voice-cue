Welcome to AudioCue, the online application that lets you find sentiments, tags, entities, and actions in your audio files instantly.
Currently, you are listening to the demo audio recorded for presentation purposes, but feel free to upload your own speech files as well.
AudioCue was built specifically as an entry for DEV.to and Deepgram hackathon from mid-March to mid-April in 2022. AudioCue is built with NextJS and based on Deepgram API.
I want to say thanks for this amazing opportunity. Building in public is the best way to learn, especially in such supportive communities as DEV.to.
If you want to try the speech recognition yourself, go to the Deepgram website and sign up for 150$ free credit to test out their awesome API yourself.
